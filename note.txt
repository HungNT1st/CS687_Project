The maximum reward for CartPole is 500, since there are 500 episodes, and in every step, it get +1. 

ac_alpha_theta = 0.001
ac_alpha_w = 0.01
=> Super bad result, the reward stay flat near 0, while baseline performs well with this param. 

ac_alpha_theta = 0.05
ac_alpha_w = 0.1
=> Better result, the reward converge to around 20.

ac_alpha_theta = 0.05
ac_alpha_w = 0.2
=> Better result with large alpha_w, converge at around 100+. However, we often have the bug probabilities contain NaN with large alpha_w. 
Another problem is that it is fluctuating a lot. 

ac_alpha_theta = 0.1
ac_alpha_w = 0.2
=> Reward = 75 ??



baseline_alpha_theta = 0.00005
baseline_alpha_w = 0.005
n_episodes = 5000
=> OK


baseline_alpha_theta = 0.0001
baseline_alpha_w = 0.01
n_episodes = 2000 
=> converge, but not to the best reward.
